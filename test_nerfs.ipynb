    "*   NeRF combines positional encoding, an MLP, and volume rendering.\n",
    "*   Training even a small model on a single image is slow on CPU.\n",
    "*   The quality depends heavily on model size, number of samples per ray, and training iterations.\n",

    "*   Implementing hierarchical sampling (coarse and fine networks/sampling).\n",
